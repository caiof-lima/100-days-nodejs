# Day 02 - MongoDB heroes API


During the second day, I built a complete CRUD API using MongoDB to store super-heroes and their information. The **concepts and technologies** used in this project to deepen my studies are:

* **Mongoose**  to define Heroes' model and make the CRUD operations into MongoDB
* **Functional Programming** 
* **Node Http Modules** to up the API server and define the routes.

## How to run

1. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

2. Rename the **environment.example.js** to **environment.js** and set your preferred MongoDB settings.

3. Run `node server.js` to start the API.
